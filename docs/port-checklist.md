# Port Checklist

Use this checklist as a phase tracker. Update each item explicitly.

Legend:

- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done

Retrofit note: this implementation predates `libgen`; this checklist records the completed libgen artifacts and validation state for the existing port.

## Intake

- [x] target repo scaffolded
- [x] GitHub repo created under `polycpp`
- [x] GitHub repo visibility verified
- GitHub repo URL: https://github.com/polycpp/moment
- GitHub repo private: no, current public release state verified with GitHub CLI
- [x] baseline readiness passed
- [x] upstream repo cloned or updated locally
- [x] upstream revision recorded in `docs/research.md`

## Upstream Analysis

- [x] repo layout inspected
- [x] entry points identified
- [x] important implementation files listed
- [x] test directories identified

- [x] aggregator header strategy decided
- [x] example strategy recorded
- [x] README structure aligned with companion repos
- [x] deliberate deviations recorded in `docs/divergences.md`

## Polycpp Ecosystem Reuse

- [x] polycpp core modules searched for reusable primitives
- [x] polycpp core reuse decisions recorded
- [x] companion libraries searched for reusable APIs
- [x] companion reuse decisions recorded

- [x] direct vs adapted vs deferred status recorded
- [x] dynamic typing adaptations recorded
- [x] framework object boundary reviewed
- [x] Node parity surface review recorded

## Testing

- [x] unit test areas listed
- [x] integration test areas listed
- [x] upstream tests or fixtures to adapt listed
- [x] security and fail-closed tests listed
- [x] release-blocking behaviors listed

## Documentation Site

- [x] docs scaffold installed
- [x] docs build command recorded
- [x] GitHub Pages workflow present
- [x] `docs/build/` ignored
- [x] generated placeholder docs tracked for replacement before public release
- [x] generated docs placeholder pages replaced with real public documentation

## Pre-Coding Gate

- [x] `docs/research.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [x] `docs/dependency-analysis.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [x] `docs/api-mapping.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [x] `docs/divergences.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [x] `docs/test-plan.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [x] strict readiness passed

## Implementation

- [x] implementation started after strict readiness
- [x] tests added as features are implemented
- [x] new divergences documented immediately
- [x] generated upstream locale corpus integrated and covered by tests

## Validation

- [x] targeted tests pass
- [x] README examples match actual code
- [x] remaining gaps are documented
- [x] `docs/test-plan.md` current validation records exact commands run

## Public Release

- [x] production-grade quality confirmed
- [x] public documentation ready
- [x] generated docs placeholder pages replaced with real public documentation
- [x] `python3 docs/build.py` passes
- [x] third-party license notices complete
- [x] GitHub repo visibility changed to public
